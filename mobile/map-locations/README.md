# Take-Home Coding Exercise

Welcome to the coding exercise! The goal of this project is to demonstrate your skills by building an app that displays a set of locations on a map in a performant manner. Please follow the instructions below to complete the exercise.

## Project Overview

This exercise involves fetching data from a JSON file stored in this repository and implementing a map view to display locations. You'll need to implement features like filtering locations by type and displaying additional information when a location is tapped.

## Instructions

1. **Fork the Repository:**
    - Please begin by forking this repository.
    - All of your changes should be committed to your fork.
    - Optional: Use pull requests with short descriptions to help explain as you go through

2. **Setup Project:**
    - Create an `android` or `ios` folder respectively in the root of this folder. This is where your project will live.

3. **Fetch Location Data:**
    - The repository contains a JSON file, `locations.json`, that lists various locations.
    - Use the raw file content feature of GitHub for fetching data (think of it as a mock API). Please point it to your forked repository, not the Voze repository.
        - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<GITHUB_ACCOUNT_NAME>/coding-exercises/master/mobile/map-locations/locations.json`
    - Your task is to parse this file and use the data within the app.

4. **Display Locations on a Map View:**
    - Create a map view in the app as the main view.
        - The data is centered around San Francisco. Please set the default location to there.
    - Plot the locations from the JSON file on the map using pins or markers.

5. **Filtering Locations:**
    - Implement a way to filter the displayed locations by `location_type`.
        - The assumption can be made the location_types are a static set and will not change.
        - You can provide a UI (e.g., dropdown menu, segmented control, etc) that allows users to select which types of locations to display on the map.
        - Please feel free to "steal" existing UI from other application such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, Zillow, etc for filtering or craft your own.
        - Optional: Distinguish between location types through the presentation of pin or markers.

6. **Additional Details on Tap:**
   - When a user taps on a location pin, show a view with more detailed information about that location.
        - Display all `attributes` inside this detail view.
        - Please feel free to "steal" existing UI from other application such as Google Maps, Apple Maps, Zillow, etc for details or craft your own.

## Requirements

- **Documentation:**
    - Please add any contextual implementation information into Implementation section at the bottom of this `README`.
    - Add code comments when relevant
    - Add information on how to get the application up and running into the Getting Started section at the bottom of this `README`.
- **Programming Language:**
    - iOS: Please focus on using Swift
    - Android: Please focus on using Kotlin (Java is still acceptable, however Kotlin is preferred)
- **Data Fetching:**
    - You may use the std library or a 3rd party library for making HTTP request.
        - If using a 3rd party library please explain why inside the Implementation section at the bottom of this `README`.
- **Map Integration:**
    - You may use any mapping library, such as MapKit
    - Please do not use a mapping library which requires an API key
- **UI/UX:**
    - Design a user-friendly interface to interact with the map and filter locations.
    - Keep it simple. This isn't a exercise to test your design skill.
- **Filtering:**
    - Implement efficient filtering of locations by their type.

## Submission

1. Once you have completed the exercise email a link to the forked repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Correctness:** Does the app fetch and display data correctly?
- **UI/UX:** Is the map view intuitive and easy to use (within reason given lack of design criteria)?
- **Code Quality:** Is the code clean, readable, follow modern architecture per environment, and well-structured?
- **Filtering:** Is filtering by location type implemented efficiently?
- **Attention to Detail:** Does the app show detailed information when a pin is tapped?

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. Good luck, and happy coding!

## Getting Started

This project requires a Google Maps API key.

**To add your Maps API key to this project:**
1. If the secrets.properties file does not exist, create it in the same folder as the local.properties file.
2. Add this line, where YOUR_API_KEY is your API key:
    `MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY`

To run the app, simply open up the `android` folder in Android Studio, run a Gradle Sync, and then run the app.

## Implementation

This project uses Retrofit for the following reasons:
1. It's ease of use. It's simple and fast to set up basic API calls.
2. It's ubiquity. Retrofit is pretty much the gold standard when it comes to Android networking libraries, and it's used almost universally.
3. Built-In type safety.
